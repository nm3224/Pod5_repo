Pod Test Repo

Now that you have created your own repo and you'll now learn how to do git collaborations. Inside this repo, each of you will see a directory in your name. This is where you will now submit your completed challenges. Below is the set of instructions on how to do this and best practices.
Keep up the great work. I am happy to be a part of your journey!

## To do before each breakout session:
- `git pull` on the **main** branch.

# To do before each breakout session:

`git pull` on the **main** branch.
>>>>>>> upstream/main
- To check which branch you are on, use `git branch`
- To change to main use, `git checkout main`.
- Then you can do `git pull`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
When you pull, you will get all the new files and changes made by our pod. You will also be able to find the class challenges in the challenge folder.

### Make a copy of the challenge file:

# Make a copy of the challenge file
>>>>>>> upstream/main

If there is a prewritten python file for the challenge, make a copy of it into your folder like this:

From inside the folder where the challenge file is:

`cp [FILE NAME TO COPY] [DESTINATION OF COPY]`

`cp temperature.py ../../serena_killion_folder`

<<<<<<< HEAD
### To do after you complete your challenge:

**Please do not push on main!**

Create your own branch. A good branch name should describe be description. for our purposes, using your name and the challenge name is sufficient. For example: `serena-temperature`
- `git checkout -b [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]` --> `git checkout -b serena-temperature`

>>>>>>> upstream/main
- `git status` -> check for new or modified files
- `git add [FILE NAME]` --> add file so git will track it
- `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"` --> commit file to git
- `git push` --> push it to the repo

- Now go to your pod's repo on GitHub.com and find the button to create a pull request.
- Make sure your base is **your pod's repo** (for example: `pod5_test_repo`) and **not** `Justice-Through_Code/pod_test_repo`
- Give a short description of your code and any questions you might have
- Create Pull Request

Your T.A will review your pull request, make any comments, and merge into the pod repo!

Beachgoers can sunbathe while taking in a lovely view of the Verazzano Bridge, bike through a scenic trail, jog along the boardwalk, kayak, play tennis, or fish off of the Ocean Breeze Fishing Pier, one of the city's most popular. A park on the beach designed especially for seniors contains chess tables, benches, and bocce courts. The beach's Fountain of Dolphins is a popular stop on any tour of the boardwalk.

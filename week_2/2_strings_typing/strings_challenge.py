# Strings Practice!

# 1. 3 ways to print multiple items

ingredient_1 = 'milk'
ingredient_2 = 'eggs'
ingredient_3 = 'flour'
ingredient_4 = 'sugar'

print('Four simple ingredients can combine to make so many different things:')
# 1.1 Print the 4 ingredients in a single print statement, as 4 separate strings (separated by commas)


# 1.2 Print the 4 ingredients using string concatenation
# (make sure what you print out is legible-- add spaces and/or commas to your string so they don't all become one word!)


# 1.3 Print out the 4 ingredients using an f-string
# (again make sure to add spaces and/or commas to make the printout make sense)



# 2. String Methods
# 2.1 Save your f-string from step 1.3 as a variable called ingredients


# 2.2 Uh oh, one of these ingredients isn't quite right. Use one of our string methods to replace 'milk' with 'butter'
# in a print statement


# When we use a string method in a print statement, does it change the string in our variable?
# 2.3 Use a string method to count the number of times that 'milk' appears in our string.


# 2.4 Let's print out our `ingredients` variable again just to be sure.


# 'milk' is still in there! To save our changes to the string, we'll need to update the variable.
# 2.5 Update our `ingredients` variable using the replace method, the same way we printed it out in step 2.2
# print `ingredients` to make sure the change stuck this time.


# 2.6 That looks better. Let's make it official: print the ingredients list all-caps now that it's right.



# 3 User Input/Type conversion
# 3.1 Let's get some user input. Create a variable called `activity`, that saves the user's input to the question:
# What is your favorite thing to do for fun?


# 3.2 Create a second variable called `frequency` that asks the user:
# Roughly how many times a week do you make time to <activity>? <-- use your `activity` variable in an f-string here


# 3.3 When the user inputs a number, what data type is it saved as?
# Print out the _type_ of the `frequency` variable to check.


# 3.4 Uncomment the print statements below, and use `type conversion` to fix the second one, allowing it to run
# print('Research shows that making time for enjoyment actually makes you more focused.')
# print(f'We recommend you {activity} at least {frequency * 2} times a week!')

        <!-- Adding some Harry Potter stuff now-->
        <h2>Here is a paragraph from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h2>
        <p class="green font_verdana">Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. 
            He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself - 
            no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. 
            It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, 
            where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; 
            at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
            The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, 
            it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.
            It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. 
            They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>

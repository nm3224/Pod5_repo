# Personal Webpage Challenge!

Your challenge here is to make a mockup of a "personal webpage" using HTML and CSS. Your site should have the following:

**Note:** for the purposes of learning HTML and CSS in this challenge, you'll be asked to make some things that might not be the *most* visually tasteful. Once you've turned in the assignment and demonstrated you can apply all the concepts, feel free to style it how you want :) 

## 1. HTML 

Your page should have a `<head>` section with metadata and your page's `<title>`, and a `<body>` section with all the content.

Content:
1. A large heading (i.e. `<h1>`) at the top with your page's title
2. A list of 3 facts about you (numbered or bullet points)
3. A smaller heading (i.e. `<h2>` or smaller), and below that, a corresponding paragraph of text that goes with the subheader. The paragraph of text can be whatever you want!
4. A hyperlink to your Github homepage
5. A hyperlink to any other site of your choice
6. An image from another webpage (i.e. `src` is a URL)
7. An image sourced from your local computer
8. A form with 1 text field and 1 numeric field
9. Add at least 2 comments to your HTML code explaining what you're doing
* **BONUS:** Add a "multiple-choice" item to your form. *Hint:* you may want to look up how to add "HTML radio button"

## 2. Add CSS styling

Write all your CSS code in a file in the same directory called `styles.css`. Update the `<head>` of your HTML file to use the CSS code you write in that file. Then, do the following

1. Make your main heading centered on the page
2. Using a class, make all paragraph text AND your list of facts about you in the font `Verdana` 
3. Using another class, make all paragraph text any color other than black
4. Using element IDs, make each of the 3 facts about you (in your list) a different color. Make only 1 of the facts written in italics. 
5. Make the labels of the form bold
* **BONUS:** Align the images at the center of the page

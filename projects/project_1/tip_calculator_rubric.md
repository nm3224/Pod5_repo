# Tip Calculator Rubric


Rather than pass/fail, the project expectations have been broken down in order to provide directed feedback and give you a clear idea of what we're looking for.



## Features

_Note: Not sure where to start? Write some pseudocode! Try thinking about each feature separately, and write a little outline of which coding concepts you'll use to make it. Do you have a good sense of how to try one piece of the project? Start there, and build on it._


| Feature |
| ------- |
| Input is successfully processed from the user |
| Tip calculations work correctly |
| Your program will run again if the user requests it |
| Your program is broken up into functions |
| A `README` file exists in the GitHub Repo |


## Code Quality

| Code Cleanliness |
| -------------- |
| Variable and function names make sense |
| Functions break code into DRY, logical chunks |
| Comments exist as needed |
| Code is not unnecessarily complicated |



**--*PLEASE NOTE*--** If you achieve the first two features and nothing else, your project is still considered successful and passing! This breakdown is meant to provide direction and clarity, and certainly, the goal should be to achieve everything here. But if some of these concepts are not fully working in your project by the due date, turn in what you have! You can always go back and edit it later, as it will live in your own personal GitHub portfolio.


## Due Date:

This project is due on Tuesday, March 8th

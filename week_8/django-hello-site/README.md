# Django challenge: make the helo world app!

In this challenge, to get started with Django, you'll remake the "Hello World" app from class and add a few extra features

# 1. Get set up for Django

* First, go to wherever you keep your JTC content (NOTE: do NOT save this in your pod-repo directory. Make a separate folder, as this project will have its own git repo.) make a `django-projects` directory there. You'll use this directory to store django apps you make in class.
* In the `django-projects` folder:
- Create a new folder called `hello-site` and cd into it
- Run `python3 -m venv venv` to create a new virtual environment (it's common practice to name your virtual environment 'venv')
- Run `source django-env/bin/activate` on Unix/MacOS or `django-env\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows to activate the virtual environment
- Run `pip install django` to install Django
- Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` (take a look at the new requirements file that popped up!)


# 2. Initialize your git instance

In your terminal, initialize a new instance of git with `git init`. Be sure to `add` and `commit` your progress as you go!

# 3. Start a new Django project

Create the project
```
$ django-admin startproject hellosite
$ ls
hellosite/
```

Then navigate into the project folder you created

```
$ cd hellosite
$ ls
manage.py*  hellosite/
```

# 4. Run Django server

Use the `manage.py` file to run the server! Don't worry about the "unapplied migrations" yet for now

```
$ python manage.py runserver

Watching for file changes with StatReloader

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

Django version 2.2.1, using settings 'hellosite.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

Go to `localhost:8000` and you should see the Django welcome screen!

# 5. Create your app

Use the `manage.py` file to start up your new app! Then inspect the files that are created

```
$ python manage.py startapp helloapp
$ ls
db.sqlite3  manage.py*  helloapp/  hellosite/
```

# 6. Register `helloapp` app with the `hellosite` project

Edit `hellosite/settings.py`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'helloapp.apps.HelloappConfig',
    ... # Leave all the other INSTALLED_APPS
]
```

Now, your `helloapp` app should be connected with the larger `hellosite` project

# 7. Migrate the database

We'll talk more about what migrations are later, but for now run this to get the initial database set up for your project. We won't use it in this project, but it'll get rid of the annoying red instruction to migrate them.

```
$ python manage.py migrate

```

# 8. Create a URL for the "hello world" app

In your `helloapp` directory, create a file called `urls.py` as below:

```python
from django.urls import path
from helloapp.views import HelloWorldView

urlpatterns = [
    # helloapp/
    path('', HelloWorldView.as_view(), name='hello_world'),
]
```

# 9. Create a view

Open `helloapp/views.py`. It will initially look like this:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
```

Let's add some code to render the view that we referenced above!

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views import View

# Create your views here.
class HelloWorldView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return render(request=request, template_name='hello_world.html')
```

# 10. Create a template

-   In `helloapp` directory create a new directory called `templates`.
-   Inside `templates` create a file called `hello_world.html`.
-   Add the code below in `hello_world.html`:

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

# 11. Add `helloapp` urls to `hellosite` project

Update `urlpatterns` in `hellosite/urls.py`

```python
"""hellosite URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('hello/', include('helloapp.urls')), # add this line of code
]
```

Go to `localhost:8000/hello`

# 12. Make the app dynamic!

Add a new a URL that takes a string parameter called `name`. The goal is to have the new page say hello to a different person, depending on the url

### In `helloapp/urls.py`

```python
from django.urls import path

from helloapp.views import HelloWorldView, HelloView

urlpatterns = [
    # helloapp/
    path('', HelloWorldView.as_view(), name='hello_world'),
    path('<name>', HelloView.as_view(), name='hello_name'),
]
```

### In `helloapp/views.py`

Let's pass this `name` parameter down to the view, then render as a dictionary for the `context` argument

```python
class HelloView(View):
    def get(self, request, name):
        context = {'name': name}
        return render(
            request=request, template_name='hello_name.html', context=context,
        )
```



### In `helloapp/templates/hello_name.html`

Finally, create a new template that will dynamically render the `name` parameter. Remember that this is using a Django template to take in `{{ name }}`, not just regular HTML!

```html
<h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
```

### Check out `localhost:8000/hello/ash` instead!

# 13. Add a `filter` to the template

This will make the name always show up using the django template for 'title' -- first letter caps

```html
<h1>Hello {{ name|title }}</h1>
```

### Try some more examples and see what happens

-   `localhost:8000/helloapp/paul`
-   `localhost:8000/helloapp/serena`
-   `localhost:8000/helloapp/alanna`
-   `localhost:8000/helloapp/yusuf`

# 14. Give a default person to greet

Go to `localhost:8000/hello` and notice that it creates an error...

-   The error `hello() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'` still requires we provide a value for the `name` parameter. Let's set a default value:

```python
class HelloView(View):
    def get(self, request, name='world'):
        context = {'name': name}
        return render(
            request=request, template_name='hello_name.html', context=context,
        )
```

Go to `localhost:8000/hello` again and make sure it works!

# 15. Make a "goodbye" page

We've given very specific code instructions for the previous steps, but this last one is a little more open-ended. However, you can use what you've learned so far to do this!

- Make an additional "goodbye" page that says "see you later" based on the url, such that going to `localhost:8000/hello/goodbye/django` results in a page as below:
- Don't worry about setting a 'default' person to say 'see you later' to here.

# 16. Wrap-up!

- Create a new GitHub repo on GitHub
- Connect your local folder to that repo (rewatch the videos or class video on how to do this, or google it!)
- Add your pod TA as a collaborator to your GitHub repo so that they can check your work (google how!)

**Congrats!!** You've just finished your first Django app of the class!
